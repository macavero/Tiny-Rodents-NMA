# Tiny-Rodents-NMA
This small project explores neural recordings from the Steinmetz et al., 2019 dataset using Neuropixels probes. Basic plots, such as raster plots aligned with eye and wheel movements, are generated to visualize neural responses.

Features

- Raster Plots: Align spikes to behavioral events.
- Trial Display: Partially reused code from Neuromatch Academy.

Acknowledgements

- Steinmetz et al., 2019 for the dataset.
- Neuromatch Academy for code used in the trial display.
